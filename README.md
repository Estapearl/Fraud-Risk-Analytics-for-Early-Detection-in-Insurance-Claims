<h1 align="center">Fraud Risk Analytics for Early Detection in Insurance Claims</h1>

<h2 align="center">Client Background</h2>

**Verita Assurance Ltd.** is a mid-sized insurance provider based in the UK, offering auto, home, travel, and business coverage. Over the past two years, the company has experienced a **14% rise in suspicious claims**, with most fraudulent activity detected only **after payouts were made**, leading to unrecoverable financial losses and higher operational costs. As claim volumes grew, the lack of a unified fraud detection process increased both financial exposure and compliance risks, prompting the need for a more proactive, data-driven solution.

The dataset analyzed contained **7,000+ claims** across various insurance types, with a **total claim value of £76.4M**. Of these, **471 claims worth £8.84M (11.6%)** were flagged as high-risk through a fraud scoring framework. The analysis revealed that **auto claims accounted for 77.5%** of high-risk claims, followed by **business claims at 22.5%**. Regionally, **London and the Midlands** recorded the highest fraud exposure. Furthermore, **16.1% of customers and several agents** showed recurring fraud patterns, emphasizing the need for tighter oversight. These insights provided a strong empirical foundation for improving fraud risk management.

This initiative aimed to transition Verita’s fraud detection from **reactive to proactive** by implementing a **fraud scoring model (0–100)** and building **real-time Power BI dashboards** to monitor risks across customers, agents, and claim types. The solution was designed to help **Veritas risk analysts and compliance officers** quickly identify, prioritize, and act on high-risk claims. Beyond fraud prevention, the system provides **senior management and regulatory teams** with clear visibility into risk exposure, ensuring better decision-making, reduced losses, and stronger customer trust.

### **Purpose and Stakeholders**

This initiative was commissioned by the **Risk Management Department** to strengthen Verita’s ability to identify and mitigate fraudulent claims before payments are made. The main objective was to leverage **historical claims data** to build a **fraud scoring framework (0–100)** that categorizes claims by risk level — **High, Medium, or Low** — based on key fraud indicators.  

By integrating these insights into **real-time Power BI dashboards**, the system enables early detection and prioritization of suspicious claims, allowing investigations to take place **before payouts occur**. This proactive approach empowers **fraud investigators, risk analysts, and compliance officers** to focus on high-risk cases, while providing **senior management and regulatory teams** with a transparent view of fraud exposure and business risk. Ultimately, it enhances decision-making, reduces financial losses, and safeguards the company’s integrity.
