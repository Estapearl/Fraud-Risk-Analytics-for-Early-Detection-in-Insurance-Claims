<h1 align="center">Fraud Risk Analytics for Early Detection in Insurance Claims</h1>

<h2 align="center">Client Background</h2>

**Verita Assurance Ltd.** is a mid-sized insurance provider based in the UK, offering auto, home, travel, and business coverage. Over the past two years, the company has experienced a **14% rise in suspicious claims**, with most fraudulent activity detected only **after payouts were made**, leading to unrecoverable financial losses and higher operational costs. As claim volumes grew, the lack of a unified fraud detection process increased both financial exposure and compliance risks, prompting the need for a more proactive, data-driven solution.

The dataset analyzed contained **7,000+ claims** across various insurance types, with a **total claim value of Â£76.4M**. Of these, **471 claims worth Â£8.84M (11.6%)** were flagged as high-risk through a fraud scoring framework. The analysis revealed that **auto claims accounted for 77.5%** of high-risk claims, followed by **business claims at 22.5%**. Regionally, **London and the Midlands** recorded the highest fraud exposure. Furthermore, **16.1% of customers and several agents** showed recurring fraud patterns, emphasizing the need for tighter oversight. These insights provided a strong empirical foundation for improving fraud risk management.

This analysis was developed in collaboration with the **Risk Management Department** to enhance early fraud detection across Verital insurance claims data. The objective is to leverage **historical claims data** to uncover recurring patterns, assign **fraud risk scores (0â€“100)**, and categorize claims into high, medium, and low-risk tiers. By integrating these insights into **real-time Power BI dashboards**, the team can now identify and investigate suspicious claims **before payouts occur**, enabling them to act swiftly, minimize financial losses, and strengthen overall **risk governance**.

### Key Analytical Focus Areas

- **Fraud Pattern Detection:** Historical claims data was analyzed to identify recurring behaviors and indicators commonly linked with fraudulent submissions, including duplicate claims, unusually high claim values and short policy tenures.  

- **Risk Scoring and Classification:** A fraud scoring model (0â€“100) was developed to categorize claims into high, medium or low-risk tiers, enabling faster prioritization for investigation before payouts are made.

- **Customer and Agent Behavior Profiling:** Customer and agent activity patterns were evaluated to uncover relationships between repeated claim submissions, claim frequency and past fraud involvement, strengthening early risk identification.  

- **Real-Time Fraud Monitoring:** Interactive Power BI dashboards were implemented to visualize risk levels across claims, customers and regions, allowing the Risk Management and Compliance teams to monitor exposure and respond proactively.
